When Users create tickets, agents are given access by the Manager. The manager will adjust the priority, assign the ticket to different agents according to their departments and determine the SLA required according to the information provided in the ticket. Once they are assigned, the user will be notified of any updates that are occurring to solve the issue or concern.

Lastly, after the agent is able to find a solution the changes are submitted. The ticket is then marked as resolved and sent to the closed ticket section as seen in the above picture.
